  abstract = {Context Management of newly diagnosed prostate cancer (PCa) is guided in part by accurate clinical staging. The role of imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), in initial staging remains controversial. Objective To systematically review the studies of MRI and/or PET/CT in the staging of newly diagnosed PCa with respect to tumor (T), nodal (N), and metastatic (M) staging (TNM staging). Evidence acquisition We performed a systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE and Web of Science databases between 2012 and 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Evidence synthesis A total of 139 studies (83 on T, 47 on N, and 24 on M status) were included. Ninety-nine (71\%) were retrospective, 39 (28\%) were prospective, and one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Most studies on T staging examined MRI, while PET/CT was used primarily for N and M staging. Sensitivity for the detection of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or lymph node invasion ranged widely. When imaging was incorporated into existing risk tools, gain in accuracy was observed in some studies, although these findings have not been replicated. For M staging, most favorable results were reported for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT, which demonstrated significantly better performance than conventional imaging. Conclusions A variety of studies on modern imaging techniques for TNM staging in newly diagnosed PCa exist. For T and N staging, reported sensitivity of imaging modalities such as MRI or PET/CT varied widely due to data heterogeneity, small sample size, and low event rates resulting in large confidence intervals and a high level of uncertainty. Therefore, uniformity in data presentation and standardization on this topic are needed. The most promising technique for M staging, which was evaluated recently in an RCT, is PSMA-PET/CT. Patient summary We performed a systematic review of currently available imaging modalities to stage newly diagnosed prostate cancer. With respect to local tumor and lymph node assessment, performance of imaging ranged widely. However, prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed favorable results for the detection of distant metastases.},

  abstract = {Abstract Due to its excellent intrinsic soft tissue contrast, magnetic resonance imaging allows excellent visualization and anatomical separation of therapy-relevant risk structures such as the mesorectal fascia, local lymph nodes, and vascular structures in patients with rectal carcinoma. This makes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a valuable evaluation method for further therapeutic stratification. In particular, MRI is indispensable for the decision to refrain from neoadjuvant therapy and to choose a primary surgical approach. In addition to the oncologically generally relevant T-, N-, and M-criteria, two further parameters are included: the extramural vascular infiltration and the circumferential resection margin. Due to the significant impact of MRI on further therapeutic decision-making, standardized MR image quality is considered essential. Key Points: \hspace{0.6em} Magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable evaluation method for further therapeutic stratification. Critical anatomic landmarks for evaluation are circumferential resection margins. Citation Format Attenberger UI, Clasen S, Ghadimi M et{$\mkern1mu$}al.

  abstract = {Author summary The majority of cancer related deaths are due to the development of secondary tumors called metastases. However, the dynamics of metastases establishment and growth and their relation with the primary tumor evolution are still not clear. A standard treatment starts with the resection of the primary tumor. At this time metastases may have already formed and still be too small to be detected. The presence of only undetectable metastases poses a challenge for deciding on the follow-up therapy. These small metastases could grow to a detectable size—thus leading to a recurrence of the disease—some time after surgery. We are interested in this time until cancer relapse. We present a mathematical model of metastases formation using tools from probability theory and estimate the model parameters for five different cancer types. Our predictions for the probability of visible metastases present at surgery and the mean time to relapse when no visible metastases are found at surgery are both in agreement with clinical data.},

  abstract = {The minor capsid protein L2 of papillomaviruses exhibits multiple functions during viral entry including membrane interaction. Information on the protein is scarce, because of its high tendency of aggregation. We determined suitable conditions to produce a functional human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 L2 protein and thereby provide the opportunity for extensive in vitro analysis with respect to structural and biochemical information on L2 proteins and mechanistic details in viral entry. We produced the L2 protein of high-risk HPV 16 in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and purified the protein under denaturing conditions. A successive buffer screen resulted in suitable conditions for the biophysical characterization of 16L2. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the refolded protein showed a homogenous monomeric species. Furthermore, refolded 16L2 shows secondary structure elements. The N-terminal region including the proposed transmembrane region of 16L2 shows alpha-helical characteristics. However, overall 16L2 appears largely unstructured. Refolded 16L2 is capable of binding to DNA indicating that the putative DNA-binding regions are accessible in refolded 16L2. Further the refolded protein interacts with liposomal membranes presumably via the proposed transmembrane region at neutral pH without structural changes. This indicates that 16L2 can initially interact with membranes via pre-existing structural features.},

The 333 patients underwent 344 classical radical neck dissections. Patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection in the NO neck (N = 71), and immediate therapeutic dissection in the N+ neck (N = 259). Detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the specific primary site. This revealed a predominance of neck node metastases in levels II, III, and IV for both oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries. Isolated ?skip? metastases outside of levels II, III, or IV occurred in only 1 patient (0.3\%). Otherwise, level I or V involvement was always associated with nodal metastases at other levels (ie, N2 disease). These data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection (anterior modified) in NO patients. Furthermore, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection for carcinomas of the oropharynx or hypopharynx.},

  abstract = {Purpose: We present the guidelines for target volume determination and delineation of head-and-neck lymph nodes based on the analysis of the patterns of nodal failure in patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods and Materials: Data pertaining to the natural course of nodal metastasis for each head-and-neck cancer subsite were reviewed. A system was established to provide guidance for nodal target volume determination and delineation. Following these guidelines, 126 patients (52 definitive, 74 postoperative) were treated between February 1997 and December 2000 with IMRT for head-and-neck cancer. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 12–55), and the patterns of nodal failure were analyzed. Results: These guidelines define the nodal target volume based on the location of the primary tumor and the probability of microscopic metastasis to the ipsilateral and contralateral (Level I–V) nodal regions. Following these guidelines, persistent or recurrent nodal disease was found in 6 (12\%) of 52 patients receiving definitive IMRT, and 7 (9\%) of 74 patients receiving postoperative IMRT had failure in the nodal region. Conclusion: On the basis of our clinical experience in implementing inverse-planning IMRT for head-and-neck cancer, we present guidelines using a simplified, but clinically relevant, method for nodal target volume determination and delineation. The intention was to provide a foundation that enables different institutions to exchange clinical experiences in head-and-neck IMRT. These guidelines will be subject to future refinement when the clinical experience in head-and-neck IMRT advances.},

  abstract = {The head and neck contain many critical, noninvolved structures in close vicinity to the targets. The tightly conformal doses produced by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and the lack of internal organ motion in the head and neck, provide the potential for organ sparing and improved tumor irradiation. Many studies of treatment planning for head and neck cancer have demonstrated the dosimetric superiority of IMRT over conventional techniques in these respects. The initial results of clinical studies demonstrate reduced xerostomia. They suggest an improvement in tumor control, which needs to be verified in larger studies and longer follow-up. Critical issues for successful outcome of head and neck IMRT are accurate selection of the neck lymph nodes that require adjuvant treatment, and accurate delineation on the planning computed tomography (CT) of the lymph-node bearing areas and subclinical disease adjoining the gross tumor.

  abstract = {The incidence of occult cervical metastasis in oral cavity cancer, even in early stages, is significant, necessitating elective treatment of the neck in a majority of cases. There is no method of imaging or other examination that will detect microscopic foci of metastatic disease in cervical lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of neck specimens reveals the incidence of occult metastases to be higher than revealed by light microscopy with ordinary hematoxylin and eosin staining. The neck may be treated electively by surgery or irradiation. Surgery has the advantage of permitting pathological staging of the neck, avoiding unnecessary radiation treatment and indicating cases where adjuvant therapy should be employed. As oral cavity cancer rarely metastasizes to level V, a radical or modified radical neck dissection of all five node levels is not necessary. Selective dissection of levels I–III (“supraomohyoid neck dissection”) is the usual procedure of choice for elective dissection of the neck. Most of the relatively small number of isolated metastasis to level IV are from primary tumours of the tongue, which are known to produce “skip” metastases. Thus an “extended supraomohyoid neck dissection” of levels I–IV is recommended by some authors for elective treatment of the neck in tongue cancer. A number of recent prospective multi-institutional studies have demonstrated that sublevel IIB is rarely involved with isolated metastasis from oral cavity primary tumours, except from some tongue cancers. Thus it is justifiable to omit dissection of sublevel IIB in elective treatment of most cases of oral cavity cancer. Bilateral neck dissection should be performed in elective treatment of tumours involving midline structures, and in patients with ipsilateral neck metastasis.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: The appropriate application of 3-D CRT and IMRT for HNSCC requires a standardization of the procedures for the delineation of the target volumes. Over the past few years, two proposals—the so-called Brussels guidelines from Grégoire et al., and the so-called Rotterdam guidelines from Nowak et al.—emerged from the literature for the delineation of the neck node levels. Detailed examination of these proposals however revealed some important discrepancies. Materials and methods: Within this framework, the Brussels and Rotterdam groups decided to review their guidelines and derive a common set of recommendations for delineation of neck node levels. This proposal was then discussed with representatives of major cooperative groups in Europe (DAHANCA, EORTC, GORTEC) and in North America (NCIC, RTOG), which, after some additional refinements, have endorsed them. The objective of the present article is to present the consensus guidelines for the delineation of the node levels in the node-negative neck. Results and conclusions: First a short discussion of the discrepancies between the previous Brussels and the Rotterdam guidelines is presented. The general philosophy of the consensus guidelines and the methodology used to resolve the various discrepancies are then described. The consensus proposal is then presented and representative CTVs that are consistent with these guidelines are illustrated on CT sections. Last, the limitations of the consensus guidelines are discussed and some concerns about the direct applications of these guidelines to the node-positive neck and the post-operative neck are described.},

  abstract = {In 2003, a panel of experts published a set of consensus guidelines for the delineation of the neck node levels in node negative patients (Radiother Oncol, 69: 227–36, 2003). In 2006, these guidelines were extended to include the characteristics of the node positive and the post-operative neck (Radiother Oncol, 79: 15–20, 2006). These guidelines did not fully address all nodal regions and some of the anatomic descriptions were ambiguous, thereby limiting consistent use of the recommendations. In this framework, a task force comprising opinion leaders in the field of head and neck radiation oncology from European, Asian, Australia/New Zealand and North American clinical research organizations was formed to review and update the previously published guidelines on nodal level delineation. Based on the nomenclature proposed by the American Head and Neck Society and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and in alignment with the TNM atlas for lymph nodes in the neck, 10 node groups (some being divided into several levels) were defined with a concise description of their main anatomic boundaries, the normal structures juxtaposed to these nodes, and the main tumor sites at risk for harboring metastases in those levels. Emphasis was placed on those levels not adequately considered previously (or not addressed at all); these included the lower neck (e.g. supraclavicular nodes), the scalp (e.g. retroauricular and occipital nodes), and the face (e.g. buccal and parotid nodes). Lastly, peculiarities pertaining to the node-positive and the post-operative clinical scenarios were also discussed. In conclusion, implementation of these guidelines in the daily practice of radiation oncology should contribute to the reduction of treatment variations from clinician to clinician and facilitate the conduct of multi-institutional clinical trials.},

Results Inclusion of the retrostyloid space cranially and the supra-clavicular fossa caudally is proposed in case of neck nodes (defined radiologically or on the surgical specimen) located in levels II, and IV or Vb, respectively. When extra-capsular rupture is suspected (on imaging) or demonstrated on the pathological specimen, adjacent muscles should also be included in the CTV. For node(s) located at the boundary between contiguous levels (e.g. levels II and Ib), these two levels should be delineated. In the post-operative setting, the entire ‘surgical bed’ should be included. Last, the retropharyngeal space should be delineated in case of positive neck from pharyngeal tumors. Conclusions The objective of the manuscript is to give a comprehensive description of the new set of guidelines for CTV delineation in the node-positive neck and the post-operative neck, with a complementary atlas of the new anatomical structures to be included.},

  abstract = {Background: The characteristics of cervical lymphatic metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are not completely understood. As such, radiotherapy to the entire lymphatic of the neck bilaterally has been empirically practiced even in early stage disease, although not supported by clinical evidence. We studied the pattern and probability of nodal metastasis through a meta-analysis of published evidences, with an aim to establish an evidence-based guideline for selecting and delineation of clinical target volume of neck lymphatics for conformation radiation for NPC. Methods: A literature search yielded an initial 411 original articles, and 13 studies with 2920 NPC cases staged via MRI were included in this analysis. The occurrence of nodal metastasis was calculated and analyzed according to the respective regional nodal levels. Results: 85\% of NPC cases presented with lymphadenopathy. The most commonly involved regions include retropharyngeal (69\%) and level II lymph nodes (70\%). The overall probability of levels III, IV, and V nodal involvement are 45\%, 11\%, and 27\%, respectively. Low-risk node groups included the supraclavicular, levels IA/IB and VI nodes, and parotid nodes with involvement rates at 3\%, 0\%, 3\%, 0\%, and 1\%, respectively. Nodal metastases followed an orderly pattern and the probability of “skip” metastasis between levels varied between 0.5-7.9\%. Conclusions: Lymph node metastasis in NPC follows a predictable and orderly pattern. The rarity of metastasis in certain nodal groups and “skip” metastasis suggest that reduced treatment volume is feasible in conformal radiotherapy for NPC.},

  abstract = {It would seem logical that patients with nodal metastases low in the neck would fare less well than patients with disease high in the neck. The penultimate UICC classification suggested that neck node level was important although there was no mention of this in the most recent classification. In addition, patients with carcinomas at the various sites would be expected to have different patterns of nodal involvement. Of 3419 patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma on the Liverpool University Head and Neck Unit database, 947 had neck node metastases. The neck node levels were coded as (I)sub-mandibular, (II) above the thyroid notch, (III) below the thyroid notch and (IV) supra-clavicular/posterior triangle nodes. Levels II and III contained the deep jugular chain. The relationship between node level and site and sub-site and survival were analysed with particular emphasis on multivariate methods. The 5-year survival for the whole group was 51\% and survival fell with decreasing node level (I-IV) being 37\% for sub-mandibular nodes, 32\% for deep cervical nodes and 25\% for lower deep cervical nodes. The 18-month survival for supra-clavicular and posterior triangle nodes was 21\%. The difference in survival was significant (x23= 24.42, P {$<$} 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that as the level of the nodes fell from the sub-mandibular refion to the supra-clavicular region the prognosis worsened (estimate = -0.3378, P = 0.0003). Level II (upper deep cervical) nodes were the most commonly involved with regards to all primary sites and formed 69\% of all neck node metastases. Over three quarters of laryngeal oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal metastases went ot this level whereas only 47\% of oral cancers did. Most of the remainder of these latter lesions metastasized to level I (42\%). These findings were confirmed by multiple logistic regression. When studying survival for lymph node level with regard to site all sites had a reducing prognosis with decrasing node level except for larynx. Multiple linear regression showed an association between decreasing node level and increasing N-stage (P = 0.001) with increasing T-stage (P = 0.0014) and as the site moved from the mouth to the larynx (P = 0.0047). The present data support the view that neck node level is important as regards prognosis for most sites in the head and neck. The data confirm the clinical view that deep cervical nodes are most frequently affected by head and neck cancer with level IV nodes being unusual and clinically tending to herald a non head and neck tumour and that level III nodes are relatively uncommon. This is surprising as one would expect at least a proportion of laryngeal carcinomas and quite a high proportion of lhypopharyngeal carcinomas to metastasize to this region.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the incidence, distribution, and spread pattern of retropharyngeal lymph node (RLN) involvement in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods and Materials: The MR images of 275 patients with newly diagnosed NPC were reviewed retrospectively. Nodes were classified as metastatic based on size criteria, the presence of nodal necrosis, and extracapsular spread. Results: Retropharyngeal lymph node involvement was detected in 175 (63.6\%) patients. Metastatic RLNs were seen at the following levels: occipital bone, 24 (9.6\%) nodes; C1, 157 (62.5\%) nodes; C1/2, 40 (15.9\%) nodes; C2, 27 (10.8\%) nodes; C2/3, 1 (0.4\%) node; and C3, 2 (0.8\%) nodes. The incidence of RLN involvement was equal to the incidence of cervical lymph node involvement (81.4\% vs. 81.4\%) in 215 patients with nodal metastases. A significantly higher incidence of metastatic RLNs was observed in the presence of oropharynx, prestyloid parapharyngeal space, post-styloid parapharyngeal space, longus colli muscle, medial pterygoid muscle, levator muscle of velum palatini, tensor muscle of velum palatini, Level II node, Level III node, and Level V node involvement. A significantly lower incidence of metastatic RLNs was found in T1, N0, and Stage I disease. Conversely, no significant difference in the incidence of metastatic RLNs was observed between T1, 2, and, 3; N2 and N3; or Stage II, III, and IV disease. Conclusions: There is an orderly decrease in the incidence of metastatic lateral RLNs from the C1 to C3 level. Metastatic RLNs associate well with involvement of certain structures in early stage primary tumors and lymph node metastases of the upper jugular chain (Level II, Level III nodes) and the posterior triangle (Level V nodes). Both RLNs and cervical Level II nodes appear to be the first-echelon nodes in NPC. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Currently, elective clinical target volume (CTV-N) definition for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is mostly based on the prevalence of nodal involvement for a given tumor location. In this work, we propose a probabilistic model for lymphatic metastatic spread that can quantify the risk of microscopic involvement in lymph node levels (LNL) given the location of macroscopic metastases and T-category. This may allow for further personalized CTV-N definition based on an individual patient’s state of disease. We model the patient's state of metastatic lymphatic progression as a collection of hidden binary random variables that indicate the involvement of LNLs. In addition, each LNL is associated with observed binary random variables that indicate whether macroscopic metastases are detected. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to compute the probabilities of transitions between states over time. The underlying graph of the HMM represents the anatomy of the lymphatic drainage system. Learning of the transition probabilities is done via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and is based on a dataset of HNSCC patients in whom involvement of individual LNLs was reported. The model is demonstrated for ipsilateral metastatic spread in oropharyngeal HNSCC patients. We demonstrate the model's capability to quantify the risk of microscopic involvement in levels III and IV, depending on whether macroscopic metastases are observed in the upstream levels II and III, and depending on T-category. In conclusion, the statistical model of lymphatic progression may inform future, more personalized, guidelines on which LNL to include in the elective CTV. However, larger multi-institutional datasets for model parameter learning are required for that.},

  abstract = {The study of stellar surfaces can reveal information about the chemical composition, interior structure, and magnetic properties of stars. It is also critical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in particular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches, which must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude stronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map the surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of inhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution stellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form solution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model explicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar spectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while simultaneously mapping the stellar surface. It therefore works on blended lines, regions of the spectrum where line formation mechanisms are not well understood, or stars whose spots have intrinsically different spectra from the rest of the photosphere. We implement the model within the open source starry framework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization and posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to infer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close agreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014). We also discuss Doppler imaging in the context of EPRV studies and describe an interpretable spectral-temporal Gaussian process for stellar spectral variability that we expect will be important for EPRV exoplanet searches.},

Randomization was 1:1 to PORT (68 Gy/25\# to prostate) or whole-pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT, 68 Gy/25\# to prostate, 50 Gy/25\# to pelvic nodes, including common iliac) using computerized stratified block randomization, stratified by Gleason score, type of androgen deprivation, prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis, and prior transurethral resection of the prostate. All patients received image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and minimum 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy. The primary end point was 5-year biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), and secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTSFrom November 2011 to August 2017, a total of 224 patients were randomly assigned (PORT = 114, WPRT = 110). At a median follow-up of 68 months, 36 biochemical failures (PORT = 25, WPRT = 7) and 24 deaths (PORT = 13, WPRT = 11) were recorded. Five-year BFFS was 95.0\% (95\% CI, 88.4 to 97.9) with WPRT versus 81.2\% (95\% CI, 71.6 to 87.8) with PORT, with an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.23 (95\% CI, 0.10 to 0.52; P {$<$} .0001). WPRT also showed higher 5-year DFS (89.5\% v 77.2\%; HR, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.22 to 0.73; P = .002), but 5-year OS did not appear to differ (92.5\% v 90.8\%; HR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.41 to 2.05; P = .83). Distant metastasis-free survival was also higher with WPRT (95.9\% v 89.2\%; HR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.15 to 0.82; P = .01). Benefit in BFFS and DFS was maintained across prognostic subgroups.CONCLUSIONProphylactic pelvic irradiation for high-risk, locally advanced prostate cancer improved BFFS and DFS as compared with PORT, but OS did not appear to differ.}

  abstract = {Many tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) spread along the lymphatic network. Current imaging modalities can only detect sufficiently large metastases. Therefore, adjacent lymph node levels (LNL) are irradiated electively since they may harbor microscopic tumors. We apply Bayesian Networks (BN) to model lymphatic tumor progression. The model can subsequently be used to personalize the risk estimation of microscopic lymph node metastases in newly diagnosed patients based on their distribution of macroscopic metastases. A BN is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution. We represent LNLs by binary random variables corresponding to the BN nodes. Each LNL is associated with a hidden microscopic state and an observed macroscopic state (e.g. 18F-FDG-PET/CT imaging). The primary tumor is represented by network input nodes. We demonstrate the concept for early T-stage oropharyngeal carcinomas and their spread to ipsilateral lymph node levels (LNL) Ib to IV. We show that the BN parameters can be efficiently learnt by merging pathology findings on microscopic tumor progression (which is limited to a few published studies) and imaging data on macroscopic tumor progression such as CT and 18F-FDG-PET (which are widely available in clinical practice). The trained network can be used to quantify how the distribution of macroscopic metastases impacts the probability of microscopic involvement of the remaining LNLs. The analysis suggests that the risk of microscopic involvement of level IV exceeds 5\% only if level III harbors metastases. Excluding level IV from the elective CTV for other patients would reduce the integral dose delivered to the patient and potentially reduce acute and late side effects.},

To eliminate potential misinterpretation, overlap, and lack of standardization, the Academy's Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology, with input from the Education Committee of the American Society of Head and Neck Surgery, has developed a classification system for these procedures. This has now been adopted by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery. The classification is based on the following concepts: (1) radical neck dissection is the fundamental procedure with which all other neck dissections are compared, (2) modified radical neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more nonlymphatic structure(s), (3) selective neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more group(s) of lymph nodes, and (4) extended radical neck dissection denotes removal of one or more additional lymphatic and/or nonlymphatic structure(s). Adherence to the principles of this classification system to describe neck dissection techniques should provide an improved method of communication. Furthermore, the system provides a rational framework on which subsequent terminology can be added.(Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1991;117:601-605)},

In this multi-institutional study, we hypothesized that direct visualization provided by MR guidance could allow the use of small treatment volumes to spare normal tissues while maintaining clinical outcomes despite the aforementioned uncertainties in MR-guided treatment.},

Treatment planning for OPSCC often utilizes positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to assess clinical stage. We hypothesize that PET/CT will accurately predict final pathologic AJCC 8th edition staging in patients with HPV+ OPSCC. Methods All patients with primary HPV+ OPSCC with preoperative PET/CT who underwent transoral robotic surgery and neck dissection between 2011 and 2017 were identified. Data were collected via chart review. Two neuroradiologists performed blinded re-evaluation of all scans. Primary tumor size and cervical nodal disease characteristics were recorded and TNM staging was extrapolated. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to assess interrater reliability. Test for symmetry was performed to analyze discordance between radiologic and pathologic staging. Results Forty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Interrater reliability was substantial between radiologists for nodal (N) and overall staging (OS) (? = 0.715 and 0.715). Radiologist A review resulted in identical OS for 67\% of patients, overstaging for 31\%, and understaging for 2\%. Radiologist B review resulted in 61\% identical OS, 39\% overstaging, and 0\% understaging. In misclassified cases, the test of symmetry shows strong bias toward overstaging N stage and OS (P?},

  abstract = {Fluorine-18 (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography fused with computed tomography (PET/CT) is a valuable tool in surgical planning for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). If performed prior to biopsy or other surgical intervention, FDG-PET/CT has high sensitivity for the detection of the primary site in patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary origin and can be used to direct the surgical workup. FDG-PET/CT is superior to CT alone for detection of nodal metastases outside the expected pattern or distant metastases or second primary cancers and can greatly affect determination of appropriate management including surgical eligibility. Prior to the advent of PET/CT, many patients undergoing (chemo)radiation-based therapy had planned post-treatment neck dissection; FDG-PET/CT now has a proven role in the evaluation of recurrent or persistent disease amenable to salvage surgery and enables safe avoidance of planned postradiation neck dissection with a high negative predictive value. Specifically for this important application, two standardized reporting metrics may be used in the head and neck anatomic region: the “Hopkins criteria” and the “Neck Imaging Reporting and Data System”; both systems produce a formalized evaluation and recommendation based on PET/CT findings. The role of PET/CT as a replacement for elective neck dissection or examination under anesthesia remains controversial but deserves further study. FDG-PET/CT has a wide-ranging impact on the surgical management of patients with HNSCC and should be used routinely in patients with unknown primary nodal disease and those presenting with advanced-stage cancers at initial staging and to assess treatment response.}

The aim of this retrospective analysis is to investigate the impact of FDG-PET/CT-based nodal target volume definition (FDG-PET/CT-based NTV) on radiotherapy outcomes, compared to conventional CT-based nodal target volume definition (CT-based NTV). Materials and methods Six-hundred-thirty-three patients treated for HNSCC with definitive (chemo)radiotherapy using IMRT/VMAT techniques between 2008 and 2017 were analyzed. FDG-PET/CT-based NTV was performed in 46\% of the patients. The median follow-up was 31\,months. Diagnostic imaging depicting the regional recurrence was co-registered with the initial CT-scan to reconstruct the exact site of the recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with radiotherapy outcome. Results FDG-PET/CT-based NTV improved control of disease in the CTVelective-nodal (HR: 0.33, p\,=\,0.026), overall regional control (HR: 0.62, p\,=\,0.027) and overall survival (HR: 0.71, p\,=\,0.033) compared to CT-based NTV. The risk for recurrence in the CTVelective-nodal was increased in case of synchronous local recurrence of the primary tumor (HR: 12.4, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Conclusion FDG-PET/CT-based NTV significantly improved control of disease in the CTVelective-nodal, overall regional control and overall survival compared to CT-based NTV. A significant proportion of CTVelective-nodal recurrences are potentially new nodal manifestations from a synchronous local recurrent primary tumor. These results support the concept of target volume transformation and give an indication of the potential of FDG-PET to guide gradual radiotherapy dose de-escalation in elective neck treatment in HNSCC.},

The histological frequency and distribution of cervical lymph node metastases was studied in 326 neck dissections from 253 patients with an intraoral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Metastasis was evident in 118 patients (47\%) and 18 had bilateral metastasis. For primary sites other than the tongue, metastasis developed initially in a node(s) in the first drainage group (level I or II) with progressive involvement of neighbouring nodes (‘overflow’). Simultaneous bilateral metastases were seen in some tumours of the floor of mouth, tongue and oropharynx which involved the midline. An erratic distribution of metastases suggestive of ‘fast-tracking’ (skip lesions and peppering) was only seen in tongue tumours. The pattern of metastatic spread indicates that level IV nodes must be included in staging and therapeutic neck dissections in tongue cancer. Metastasis to ‘accessory’ lymph nodes (lingual, buccal) occurs infrequently but may explain some ‘local’ recurrences.},

Metastasis was evident in 47\% of patients including bilateral metastases in 6\%, extracapsular spread in 29\% and matting in 7\%. The extent of metastasis (both volume and distribution) was greatest in tumours of the oropharynx followed by lateral tongue, ventral tongue and floor of mouth. The typical 'inverted-cone pattern' was seen in 67\% of patients with metastasis. A single micrometastasis was seen in 14\%, skip lesions in 10\% and involvement of 'other' nodal groups in 4\%. Contralateral neck metastases (0.4\%), peppering (2\%), flushing of lymph node sinuses (1\%) and all nodes positive (0.4\%) accounted for the remaining 'aberrant' patterns. Skip lesions were seen in tumours at all sites other than retromolar.},

  abstract = {One practical problem with building large scale Bayesian network models is an expo- nential growth of the number of numerical parameters in conditional probability tables. Obtaining large number of probabilities from domain experts is too expensive and too time demanding in practice. A widely accepted solution to this problem is the assumption of independence of causal influences (ICI) which allows for parametric models that define conditional probability distributions using only a number of parameters that is linear in the number of causes. ICI models, such as the noisy-OR and the noisy-AND gates, have been widely used by practitioners. In this paper we propose PICI, probabilistic ICI, an extension of the ICI assumption that leads to more expressive parametric models. We provide examples of three PICI models and demonstrate how they can cope with a com- bination of positive and negative influences, something that is hard for noisy-OR and noisy-AND gates.},
